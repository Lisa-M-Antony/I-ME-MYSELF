# The Great Alaskan Boyfriend

ALASKA – The first time I heard about this North American state was a few years back. My thoughts are battling inside my head, asking if I should give a detailed introduction about Alaska. I don't think so. The Alaska I want to talk about is the one I know, the Alaska I am always envious of, the Alaska Chris has shown me. This is not about Alaska, this is about Chris.

Like every other reader, I research a book before I read it. Being a fan of fiction didn't stop me from going for a travel biography – "Into the Wild". Though I learned about the movie adaptation, I decided that I wouldn't watch the movie until I completed the book. Books are more imaginative for me. But a phone call with my best friend changed my mind. The moment I watched the trailer, I saw the lust in his eyes every time he said 'Alaska'.

Christopher John McCandless. It was only a few pages, but I already started falling for a man who doesn't exist anymore. Maybe it was not affection. It could be a thirst to be like him, to own what he owned – his own Alaska. Alaska meant freedom, meaning and adventure for him. He took off, he left his car behind when it became a burden and continued on foot. He didn't let anything come between his dream and him. Chris was brave. He had no second thoughts about leaving everything behind to go search for something that was never promised to be given. But he was entirely a new person – Alexander Supertramp, Alex.

Alex never revealed his true identity to anyone. Either he didn't want the remains of a life he left behind or he didn't want anyone finding where he was. He didn't completely avoid people, he only wanted a life that would keep him away from all the expectations and the materialism of the world. The attachment Alex had with Jan Burres and Wayne Westerberg was warm and real. He just never stayed anywhere too long to get tethered by feelings.

> "At long last he was unencumbered and emancipated from the stifling world of his parents and peers, a world of abstraction and security and material excess, a world in which he felt grievously cut off from the raw throb of existence."

I loved how the author Jon Krakauer used the words 'unencumbered and emancipated' to describe Alex's feelings. These are the two words that drew me toward my great Alaskan boyfriend. He did walk away, unlike me.

I am scared to even dream about feeling unencumbered and emancipated. I am bound by all the expectations and responsibilities I have on me. It might all be because of how Alaska took him away from me. He went into the wild, and the wilderness took his life. Knowing where he went, I didn't have the courage to continue reading the book. I wanted to relive all the freedom he enjoyed again and again. But the hallucinating word choices of the author kept me reading. Chris brought all the emotions back to me. Even after years, my heart aches, "if only he had visited his family before he left."
